<h1>Welcome to Roland's "Sales Funnel Builder"</h1>

<p>In this project, Roland is starting to build a tool that could be used to create Sales Funnels.</p>

<p>The project was started on January 19th, 2020 and has been added to daily since inception.</p>

<p>You are encouraged to clone the repo, run "npm install" and "npm start" on your own local machine to see what it looks like loaded up.</p>

<p>If you don't feel like doing that, just check out the code in Palette.js, Customize.js, and reducer.js, to get started. Most of the app's logic lives in there.</p>
